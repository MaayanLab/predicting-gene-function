Contains files about the new site (IDG genes and their predicted functions).
Site is not complete - partial exploration of its creation.

Most complete version:
* genePages.py
* some-gene.html
* test-home.html
* style.css
* style_some_gene.css

Note:
Needs complete predicted sets for each gene to run website. (To get predicted sets, need new GMTs of all Enrichr libaries.
Currently all done and saved on hard drive.)

(An example of the text file needed for the website is provided: predicted_z_ADCK2.txt.)
