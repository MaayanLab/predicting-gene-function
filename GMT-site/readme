Contains files about the new site (IDG genes and their predicted functions).
Site is not complete - partial exploration of its creation.

Note:
Needs complete predicted sets for each gene to run website. (To get predicted sets, need new GMTs of all Enrichr libaries.
Currently all done and saved on hard drive.)
