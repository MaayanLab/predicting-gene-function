Folder contains miscellaneous data:
* Data necessary to make violin plots for GMTs and PPIs
  ** Note: The violin data needs to be uploaded and converted to an R data.frame before being used. The NA values should be removed,
     and the columns should be named c("Genes", "AUC", "Expression"). Understanding of the graphics(2).R script will help in this.
* Result of t-test on the GMT AUCs
